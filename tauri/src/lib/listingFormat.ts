 * a view that spelled either of them its own way would leave the columns out of
 * alignment — so the spellings live here, arithmetic rather than template
 * strings spread across components.
 *
 * The two annotations an analyst can make — a name and a type — are keyed the
 * same way and stored in the same order, `"<func>:<key>"`, so a header cell can
 * look its value up without knowing which table it came from.
